June 10, 2020 Hey, Thanks for reading and making Wednesday my new favourite day of the week. A lot of you have suggested video formats, which is great, they’ve been FANTASTIC! I should say that I’m open to all kinds of formats - radio/games/quiz/social/magazines. I’d love to see a joke format unpacked if anyone has a favourite. This week’s unpacking comes from Chris Unitt. Chris writes the brilliant Cultural Digital newsletter, which is a must read for anyone interested in how cultural organisations show their work online. He’s also the founder of research and analytics consultancy One Further. Over to Chris… What’s it called?Hot Ones (YouTube series) What’s the format? Hot Ones is the show \"with hot questions, and even hotter wings.” It’s a YouTube series where celebrities answer questions while eating chicken wings smothered with hotter and hotter sauces. What’s the magic that made it special? The special magic ingredient - the spice in the sauce, if you will - is the way that each 20+ minute interview is guaranteed to become more compelling as it goes along. How many interview shows can you say that about? The questions posed by the host, Sean Evans, are well researched softballs. The guests would all be having a comfortable enough time if they weren’t having to endure increasing levels of physical pain. Army training prepares you for this sort of thing, media training not so much. By the time you reach Da Bomb - the scorching hot and apparently not-even-that-tasty 8th sauce - it's hard not to let your personality show through. Will the guest tear into the wings with reckless abandon, or nibble them timidly? Tough it out, or sweat and swear profusely? Persevere or make excuses and quit? That’s the joy of it. There are plenty of gimmicky celebrity interview series on YouTube right now. They’ve displaced the churned-out press junket interview in a world where, audiences are built on share-ability and you’ve got to be remarkable to stand out. I reckon Hot Ones has perfected the formula. Favourite Episode?Gordon Ramsey Or maybe Halle Berry, Charlize Theron, or Shia LaBeouf. Similar Formats:Nardwuar Radio 1 Playground Insults Jimmy Kimmel - Celebrities Read Mean Tweets  Thank Chris, I’ve been obsessed since Chris first pointed me towards Hot Ones. It’s hugely entertaining and builds brilliantly. Sean is a great host - he’s very likeable and takes the heat in his stride. And it’s always good to watch Noel Gallagher suffer. If you have thoughts send them over. And let me know if you’d like to contribute. More unpacking next Wednesday. Thanks for reading.

      "10 creative ways to interview celebrities and experts\n",
      "Go beyond the worn-out Q&A format and get your interviewees to share in-depth and personal stories\n",
      "Posted: 2 September 2024 By: Jacob Granger\n",
      "Credit: Screenshots via Vanity Fair, British GQ, BT Sport, Hot Ones \n",
      "Tired of the bog-standard sit-down interview? There are more creative ways to talk to experts or famous guests and discuss a subject close to them, their career or a general topic of interest.The typical back-and-forth exchange does not always help people to go off-script. It also does not help audiences understand complex topics. Some media companies now employ themes, games, props and other devices to get their guests talking and audiences hooked. These work best in video series that viewers can subscribe to on platforms like YouTube or follow on Instagram but you can also add a video feature to your website.Here, we compile some of the best examples of creative interviewing ploys. These videos get thousands - even millions - of views and are a good place to start if you have a creative block.Impossible challengesChallenge videos are trendy on social media. You see it a lot in sports-related content where fans do \"blind rank challenges\" which task them to rank players without seeing which player comes next. It can lead to some funny moments when professionals also take part in this popular format. \n",
      "Football channel GOAL enjoys a lot of success with this, as well as the \"stay quiet\" challenge and the \"build the perfect footballer\" challenge. They have also gotten celebrities and famous journalists to take part.Ten EssentialsYou can tell a lot about someone based on the ten items they cannot live without. That is the thinking on the British GQ's series Ten Essentials, where celebrity guests show and tell their most precious possessions.\n",
      "Fans will love to see the human side of their idols. And it is guaranteed some light-hearted moments and chuckles.GQ also runs a series called Actually Me where famous guests respond anonymously to fan questions via social media platforms, and Tattoo Tour as an interesting way for well-known guests to talk about the meaning behind their inkwork.What I WoreAny sports fan will tell you that the jersey or shirt holds a lot of significance. For the players, a shirt can remind them of highs and lows, breakthroughs and setbacks, the special moments - and the days to forget.\n",
      "That is the approach that BT Sport takes with its series 'What I Wore'. The series is hosted by Andrew Mensah who takes football stars through an impressive collection of shirts that tell their career story. That might be the shirt they wore for their first club, one for a stand-out match, even the shirts of their biggest rivals. It prompts the guest to reminisce and open up on their deepest feelings.Mensah also always asks one question at the end of the interview: if you were in a burning building and you can save two shirts - one for the sentimental value and one for the aesthetic value - which two would you pick?Fact or FictionThere is a good reason why universities do not accept citations in your essays from Wikipedia - it is notoriously unreliable.\n",
      "One series by music news publisher Loudwire allows famous guests to correct the record once and for all, and many are happy to be given the platform to do so. In 'Fact or Fiction', interviewees are presented with a bunch of information pulled from their Wikipedia entries, and they either debunk the claim or add insightful personal anecdotes. Both scenarios happen regularly.5 levelsJournalists are taught from day one not to assume knowledge. We are told to either say things like we are explaining it to a child or an elderly person. Why not turn that into reality?\n",
      "Wired's series '5 Levels' takes tricky topic and explains it in five stages of increasing complexity. How? An expert is brought in to explain the topic to five people each with a very different knowledge base: a child, a teen, a college student, a grad student, and an expert.For the viewer, this is a natural way to explore tough topics in a way that gets more technical, without jumping the gun. Other honourable mentions by Wired go to its auto-complete interviews, where famous guests answer questions from 'the web's most searched queries' about them. Other experts, like morticians, are pulled in to respond to common queries about topics of interest. But Wired is not the only publisher to do this style of interview.Slow ZoomThere are other ways to draw the audience into an interview. One is with personal questions, the other is through camera techniques. Vanity Fair uses both in its series 'Slow Zoom'.\n",
      "It does what it says on the tin. It very slowly zooms in on a celebrity guest (using a camera on a sliding track), all the while asking increasingly deep and personal questions. The effect is twofold: the viewer is pulled into the interview visually and emotionally. It also uses greyscale outtakes to reset the camera and move on to the next set of questions.Chicken Shop DateAmelia Dimoldenberg's hit series 'Chicken Shop Date' sees her interview well-known rappers and musicians in a fried chicken shop under the pretence of a date.\n",
      "Dimoldenberg told LADbible that she wanted to avoid boring conventional interviews where music artists end up typically talking about influences and tours. It is a bit bizarre - and there is definitely some acting going on - but in this setting, guests' guards are lowered and no questions are off the table. She has also managed to lure football players and other influencers onto the show. Hot OnesSticking with the food theme, the famous Hot Ones challenge - now in its twentieth season - invites celebrity guests onto the show to discuss all manner of subjects - while working through increasingly spicy chicken wings.Watch astrophysicist Neil deGrasse try to explain the wonders of the universe while enduring severe Scoville levels. Other famous names that have not chickened out include Gordon Ramsay, Elijah Wood, Ricky Gervais and Shaq O'Neal to name a few.\n",
      "You will find plenty more food-themed interview series on the First We Feast channel, as well.The GapLADbible might be known for light-hearted, viral content. But it has some serious video series in its locker too, like 'The Gap', bringing together two people a generation apart but with shared experiences.\n",
      "This can foster some eye-opening conversations about homelessness, mental health of athletes, crime and life as a soldier. It covers how much has changed over time - for better or worse - and what challenges still remain. A more polarising option can be seen in its series 'Agree to disagree', a head-to-head style interview that pits two people with opposing views together. Sometimes they find common ground, sometimes they reach an impasse. That can be something as light as views on superheroes or as divisive as animal rights.FirstThe first time you try something will usually leave a powerful memory in your mind.\n",
      "The now-defunct channel Soccer AM by Sky Sports had a good idea with its series \"First\" which asked guests puerly about their first experiences in the game. The above video with Pep Guardiola explores his first match in management, his first trophy, and his first mistake. That gives a lot of room for follow up questions and revealing insights.Note also how the video thumbnail is also thematic, with the guest posing with one finger in the air. All their guests do this.Sky Sports did something similar with Pep Guardiola recently, not as a series, but a video titled \"same interview, 8 years later.\" The idea was to revisit an interview from eight years ago and put the same questions to him to see how much has changed.Expert ReactsIt is common for films and video games these days to be based on history, mythology and religion. Naturally, there is no better way to know how faithful it is than to ask an expert.\n",
      "Video game news publisher IGN invites experts to unpick all the details which games do - and do not - get right in its series 'Expert reacts'. Reaction videos have become a standard format on platforms like YouTube, and this series definitely takes inspiration from this.Insider does something very similar with its series 'How Real Is It?' which uses experts to assess how accurate movie scenes are.Honourable mention: NardwuarRule one of interviewing is research and this is really just a lesson in taking preparedness to the extreme. Nardwuar is an eccentric, one-of-a-kind music journalist who built his name through forensically-specific questions to music artists. Viewer discretion: the below video contains a lot of swearing and bad language. But watch as Nardwaur stuns his interviewees by bringing up the most niche of knowledge - think high school radio stations, debut stage names, childhood friends, pet projects and demo releases. He even presented Snoop Dogg with a VHS copy of his debut film, that not even he had in his possession. Guaranteed laughs, reactions and original insights.\n",

You research like a detective. You can ask questions smooth as butter. But your interviews still aren’t meeting your expectations.And the issue is you can’t pinpoint where you’re losing viewers. It could be at any moment.Predictable format. Surface-level topics. Missed connections. Awkward silences.So we’re breaking down Sean Evans’ interview magic into 4 key steps to help you create content that keep your audience coming back for more.Step 1: Deep dive researchStep 2: Connect the unexpected dotsStep 3: Craft surprising questionsStep 4: Deliver with genuine curiosityWriter? Journalist? Podcast host? Content creator?Apply these interview strategies to elevate your:Feature ArticlesPodcast EpisodesViral Video ContentProfile PiecesRoundtable DiscussionsCase Study / Success Story InterviewsLet’s break it down.To illustrate each step, we’ll use a hypothetical guest: Keanu Reeves, actor and internet’s favorite nice guy.Step 1: Deep Dive ResearchGo beyond the obvious sourcesIMDb and Wikipedia are just the starting pointLook for indie publications, podcast appearances, fan forumsExample: Keanu's passion for motorcycles and his company, Arch Motorcycle2. Unearth the obscureChildhood anecdotes, early career struggles, little-known hobbiesExample: Keanu's experience as a youth hockey goalie, nicknamed \"The Wall\"3. Follow the breadcrumbsOne piece of information often leads to anotherExample: Keanu's bass guitar playing in the band Dogstar leads to his friendship with the Red Hot Chili Peppers4. Track their passionsWhat lights them up outside of their main career?Example: Keanu's love for Shakespeare and his portrayal of Hamlet on stage5. Note the controversies (but tread lightly)Be aware of sensitive topics, but don’t shy away if relevantExample: The \"Sad Keanu\" meme and how it affected himReflection Point: Think about your favorite interview you’ve ever watched or read. What made it stand out? Was it the depth of knowledge the interviewer seemed to have about their guest?Step 2: Connect the Unexpected DotsLook for unusual intersectionsWhere do their different interests or experiences overlap?Example: How does Keanu's martial arts training for \"The Matrix\" influence his motorcycle design?2. Find the recurring themesWhat patterns emerge across their life and career?Example: Keanu's repeated portrayal of characters named John (John Constantine, Johnny Utah, John Wick)3. Contrast the public persona with lesser-known factsWhat surprises might the audience discover?Example: Keanu's reputation for kindness vs. his intense, action-packed roles4. Connect past and presentHow do early experiences inform current projects?Example: How did Keanu's experience in \"Speed\" influence his approach to stunts in \"John Wick\"?5. Find the human angle in professional achievementsWhat personal growth came from career milestones?Example: How has the success of \"The Matrix\" affected Keanu's philosophy on life?Reflection Point: When was the last time you made an unexpected connection in a conversation? How did it change the dynamic or lead to a more interesting discussion?Step 3: Craft Surprising QuestionsStart with a standard question, then twist itStandard: “What’s your favorite role?”Twisted: “If you had to be trapped in the world of one of your movies forever, which would it be and why?”2. Use specific details to show you’ve done your homeworkExample: In a 1994 interview, you mentioned wanting to play Macbeth. Now that you've played Hamlet, has that ambition changed?3. Create hypothetical scenarios that blend their experiencesExample: If you could form a band with any three of your past co-stars, who would you pick and what instrument would each play?4. Ask about the road not takenExample: You turned down the role of Chris Shiherlis in 'Heat'. How do you think taking that role might have changed your career trajectory?5. Encourage storytelling with open-ended questionsExample: You've worked with some legendary directors. Can you tell us about a day on set that completely changed your perspective on filmmaking?Reflection Point: Consider an interview you’ve conducted or a important conversation you’ve had recently. What question do you wish you had asked? How might it have changed the outcome?Step 4: Deliver with Genuine CuriosityListen activelyRespond to their answers, not just your prepared questionsExample: If Keanu mentions a particular stunt, ask for more details even if it wasn't in your original plan2. Show your enthusiasmYour genuine interest will encourage more open responsesExample: I was fascinated to learn about your love for motorcycles. Can you walk us through the process of designing a bike?3. Create a comfortable atmosphereUse humor and casual language to put them at easeExample: I heard you're a big fan of Shake Shack. Compared to their menu items, how spicy is this wing?4. Be ready to go off-scriptSome of the best moments come from spontaneous conversationIf Keanu starts talking about a book he’s reading, explore that tangent5. End with a bangSave a particularly intriguing or fun question for lastExample: If you could commission a statue of yourself in any pose, holding any object, to be placed anywhere in the world, what would it be and where would you put it?Reflection Point: Think about a time when someone showed genuine interest in something you were passionate about. How did it make you feel? How did it affect your willingness to open up?And there you have it.No more surface-level chit-chat. No more recycling the same old press junket questions. No more missing out on those genuine, meme-worthy moments.This Sean Evans-inspired process should give you the tools to dig deep, make unexpected connections, and ask questions that will have your guests saying, “Wow, I’ve never been asked that before!”Remember, the magic of Sean’s interviews isn’t just in his semi-torturous wings gimmick. It’s in the preparation, the genuine curiosity, and the creative risks he takes to surprise and delight his guests.So ask yourself: what’s one unexpected question you could ask in your next interview or important conversation that might lead to a deeper, more engaging exchange?InterviewInterview QuestionsPodcastYouTubeResearch----FollowWritten by Steven Abraham6 Followers·5 FollowingSouthern California-based fractional creative director and consultant with 15 years of experience in copywriting and content marketing.FollowNo responses yetHelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams\n",

      "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThought: I have found a variety of sources, including YouTube videos and articles, related to the \"Hot Ones\" show format. These can help identify common elements that are popular and ways to differentiate our video concept. Now, I will analyze these sources to suggest ways to make our video unique.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suggestions for Differentiating Our Video:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Unique Celebrity Selection**: While \"Hot Ones\" often features well-known celebrities, consider interviewing up-and-coming influencers, niche internet personalities, or local heroes. This can tap into their dedicated fan bases and offer fresh perspectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Local Twist on Wings**: Incorporate locally sourced hot sauces or flavors from various cultures to give the wings a unique twist. This not only highlights local businesses but also introduces viewers to new flavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Interactive Audience Participation**: Encourage viewers to participate by voting on which questions to ask or which sauces to use next. This can be done through social media platforms prior to filming.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Behind-the-Scenes Content**: Offer behind-the-scenes footage showing the preparation of the wings, the setup of the interviews, or bloopers. This additional content can provide a fuller experience and increase engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Thematic Episodes**: Create themed episodes around specific events or holidays, such as \"Spicy Valentine\" or \"Hot Summer Challenge,\" to keep content fresh and timely.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Collaborative Segments**: Partner with other YouTube channels or content creators for special episodes, blending audiences and expanding reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Incorporate Challenges**: Add unique challenges or games for the celebrities to engage in while eating the wings, such as trivia questions or completing tasks, to increase entertainment value.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Focus on Charitable Causes**: Use the series as a platform to promote charitable causes, where celebrities can choose to donate to a charity after completing the challenge, thus adding a philanthropic element.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Interactive Hot Sauce DIY**: Include segments where celebrities attempt to make their own hot sauce, guided by a chef, to add an educational component.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Viewer-Submitted Questions**: Allow viewers to submit questions for the celebrities, increasing interaction and making viewers feel part of the show.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: To ensure our \"Hot Ones Style: Interviewing Celebrities Over Spicy Wings\" video stands out, consider these unique elements: Interview up-and-coming influencers or local heroes; use locally sourced or culturally diverse hot sauces; involve audience participation via social media; offer behind-the-scenes content; create thematic episodes; collaborate with other content creators; introduce unique challenges; focus on charitable causes; include DIY hot sauce segments; and incorporate viewer-submitted questions.
