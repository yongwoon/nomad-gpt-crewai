(NYSE:CRM)? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 11:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: CRM +1.40% Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth of 12% on the NYSE over the last few months. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Salesforce’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Salesforce What Is Salesforce Worth? Great news for investors – Salesforce is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $455.86, but it is currently trading at US$319 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Salesforce’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility. What does the future of Salesforce look like? NYSE:CRM Earnings and Revenue Growth January 14th 2025 Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Salesforce's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 58%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. What This Means For You Are you a shareholder? Since CRM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation. Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CRM for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CRM. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.

Though the U.S. software market grew 59% in 2023 and 23% in 2024, development projections still fall short of historical averages. The company forecasts more upside from Agentic AI's proliferation, higher business IT spending, and continuous cloud adoption. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CRM. While HubSpot gains from a boom in small and medium-sized business activities, Salesforce leads in combining this technology into front-office processes.Using AI developments in infrastructure and applications, Microsoft gains an advantage; ServiceNow keeps great momentum using its cloud and back-office systems. Other noteworthy references are Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG), for its observability, GitLab (NASDAQ:GTLB), for its DevOps breakthroughs, and Global E-Online (NASDAQ:GLBE), a leader in cross-border e-commerce. With more effective measurements and more market possibilities, five 9 (NASDAQ:FIVN), Monday.com (NASDAQ:MNDY), and Asana (NYSE:ASAN) also indicate upside potential ahead.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CRM. As of 2025-01-14, Salesforce Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $303.13. It's currently trading at a price of $319.07. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -5.26%. The company is fair valued. Unlocking Intrinsic Value: Analysis of Salesforce Inc The model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Salesforce Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps. Assumptions Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $9.7 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.78%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 36.90% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation. Calculation Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 366.25 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 561.77 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 303.13 Discounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $378.63. This valuation indicates that the Salesforce Inc is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 15.73%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page. Story Continues The Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model: Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized. Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate. Navigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).

(CRM): A Bull Case Theory Ricardo Pillai Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 2:06 AM 3 min read In This Article: CRM +1.40% We came across a bullish thesis on Salesforce, Inc. (CRM) on Disruptive analytics’ Substack by Magnus Ofstad. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on CRM. Salesforce, Inc. (CRM)'s share was trading at $317.85 as of Jan 10th. CRM’s trailing and forward P/E were 52.36 and 28.49 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A close-up of a computer monitor, displaying complex information management software. 2025 will be a defining year for AI, as it shifts from a speculative concept to a core driver of productivity and business transformation. Salesforce, a leader in customer relationship management (CRM), is uniquely positioned at the forefront of this change, acting as a bellwether for AI adoption in the business world. Given its deep ties to customer engagement and data-driven processes, if Salesforce's clients—those who are already at the cutting edge—fail to embrace AI agents to improve efficiency, it raises the question of who will. This sets the stage for Salesforce's revenue performance in 2025 to serve as a crucial litmus test for AI's role in reshaping business operations. The journey to AI integration is not instantaneous. It's a gradual process, requiring both technological innovation and cultural adaptation. For Salesforce, this evolution is reflected in its work with Agentforce 2.0, an AI-driven platform that automates previously time-consuming tasks such as customer support and recruitment. Notably, Agentforce has reduced human intervention in daily support requests by half, allowing customer support teams to focus on more strategic priorities. Additionally, the platform has streamlined recruitment for Adecco, where AI agents sift through millions of resumes, significantly reducing manual workloads and enhancing recruiter efficiency. The same technology has found applications in healthcare with Pristina Health, where AI agents monitor patients' health in real time, leading to better patient outcomes and reduced hospital readmissions. These success stories highlight the immediate advantages that AI agents bring to businesses. By automating routine tasks, companies can free up valuable time for teams to engage in more high-value activities. However, Salesforce emphasizes that the full potential of AI will be realized over a longer period, with three years being the typical timeline for businesses to fully integrate AI into their operations and see maximum benefits. This slow burn presents both an opportunity and a risk for investors, as early AI successes could be overshadowed by the need for long-term strategic adaptation. Story Continues The stock market is divided on Salesforce's future prospects. Some analysts have raised their price targets, citing the success of Agentforce as a driver for future growth. Others are more cautious, noting economic uncertainties and a potential slowdown in IT spending that could negatively affect Salesforce's growth trajectory. They also express concerns that CRM may not fully capitalize on the AI space without acquiring additional companies with established AI expertise. As we move through 2025, Salesforce’s performance will be a key barometer for the broader market’s response to AI. If CRM continues to drive growth through AI adoption, it will provide a clear signal that AI is truly becoming a mainstream business tool. Investors should watch CRM closely, as its performance will offer critical insights into the pace of AI integration across industries and its ability to reshape business models and productivity. Salesforce, Inc. (CRM) is on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

      "\n",
      "1. **Trend Analysis**:\n",
      "   - The stock started with a high of around $357.66 on December 16, 2024, and closed at $323.54 on January 14, 2025.\n",
      "   - There is a clear downtrend over the month, with the stock price decreasing from its peak in mid-December.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Support and Resistance Levels**:\n",
      "   - **Resistance**: Early in the month, the stock faced resistance around the $357-$356 range. This level was tested on December 16 and December 17 but failed to hold.\n",
      "   - **Support**: There seems to be some support around $316-$320, as observed in the last few entries of the data. The stock bounced back from these levels on January 10 and January 13.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Key Movements**:\n",
      "   - On December 20, there was a significant volume spike, with the stock moving from a low of $331.14 to close at $343.65. This indicates a potential reversal attempt or short-term buying interest.\n",
      "   - The stock saw a consistent drop after December 24, ending with a low close of $317.85 on January 10, indicating bearish momentum.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Volatility**:\n",
      "   - The stock exhibited high volatility, particularly in late December and early January, with significant day-to-day price swings.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Volume Analysis**:\n",
      "   - Higher volumes on December 18 and December 20 suggest strong trading activity, which often correlates with significant price movements or market reactions to external news/events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this technical analysis, Salesforce's stock appears to be in a short-term bearish phase, with potential support near the $316-$320 level. Investors might look for confirmation of support or a reversal pattern before considering entry points. The resistance around $356 remains a crucial level to watch for any potential upward movement.\n",

This information, combined with the recent news and technical analysis insights, allows me to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the market sentiment and potential stock performance for Salesforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: Based on the recent analysis of Salesforce (CRM), several notable shifts in market sentiment have been observed:\n",

      "1. **Financial Health and Performance**: Salesforce's financial data suggests a strong position with significant revenue growth from $21.25 billion in 2021 to $34.86 billion in 2024. The company's net income has also seen substantial improvement, indicating enhanced profitability. The balance sheet shows a healthy level of cash and cash equivalents, which supports operational flexibility and strategic investments.\n",

      "2. **Insider Transactions**: The insider transaction data reveals consistent sales of shares by executives, which could be perceived as a lack of confidence in the company's short-term stock performance. However, it could also be part of planned diversification strategies by the insiders. Investors should consider this alongside other factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Market Sentiment and Technical Analysis**: Recent news highlights Salesforce's advancements in AI and cloud technology, which are positive indicators for future growth. However, the technical analysis indicates a bearish trend with fluctuating support and resistance levels, suggesting potential volatility in the stock price in the near term.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Impact on Stock Performance**: The combination of strong financial performance and strategic advancements in technology positions Salesforce well for long-term growth. However, the current bearish technical trend and insider sales may result in short-term volatility. Investors should be cautious and consider these factors when making decisions, potentially looking for buying opportunities during any dips if they believe in the long-term prospects of the company.\n",

      "   - For long-term investors, maintaining or slightly increasing their position in Salesforce is recommended, leveraging the company's growth trajectory and market leadership in cloud-based solutions.\n",

      "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mTo perform a detailed technical analysis of Salesforce's stock, we have gathered the most recent one-month stock price data. Here's the analysis based on this data:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Recent Trends**:\n",
      "   - Salesforce's stock has experienced a decline from mid-December 2024 to mid-January 2025. The stock opened at approximately $350 on December 16, 2024, and closed at $323.54 on January 14, 2025.\n",
      "   - There was a notable drop in price around January 2, 2025, where the stock closed at $330.66, and further declines were observed in early January 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Support and Resistance Levels**:\n",
      "   - **Support Levels**: The stock has shown support around the $316-$320 range, as evidenced by the lows on January 10, 2025, and January 13, 2025. This aligns with the previously mentioned support level.\n",
      "   - **Resistance Levels**: The resistance seems to be around $356, observed in mid-December 2024, where the stock reached a high of $357.66.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Chart Patterns**:\n",
      "   - The data suggests a bearish trend, with consistent lower highs and lower lows from December 2024 into January 2025.\n",
      "   - There appears to be a descending triangle forming, with the horizontal support around $316-$320 and descending resistance from $357 to about $330.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Volume Analysis**:\n",
      "   - Higher volumes were observed on December 20, 2024, potentially indicating significant selling pressure as the stock closed lower.\n",
      "   - Volume spikes on January 10, 2025, suggest increased trading activity as the stock approached the $316-$320 support zone.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Potential Entry Points and Price Targets**:\n",
      "   - **Entry Point**: Given the support around $316-$320, this could be a potential entry point for investors looking to capitalize on a reversal or bounce-back.\n",
      "   - **Price Target**: If the stock reverses from the support, initial targets could be set around $335 (previous support turned resistance) and then around $356.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Volatility and Market Sentiment**:\n",
      "   - The stock has shown high volatility, especially in late December 2024 and early January 2025. This aligns with the context of high trading volumes during this period.\n",
      "   - Market sentiment remains mixed due to the potential for long-term growth, offset by short-term volatility and insider selling activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, Salesforce's stock is currently in a bearish trend, with significant support around $316-$320 and resistance around $356. The stock is trading below its intrinsic value with projected earnings growth, which might attract long-term investors. However, the short-term volatility and insider selling indicate caution is warranted. Investors might look for buying opportunities around the support levels, with an eye on potential rebounds or trend reversals.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Chart Patterns**:\n",
      "   - The stock has shown a descending channel pattern over the past month, indicating a bearish trend. This pattern is characterized by lower highs and lower lows, evident from the gradual decrease in closing prices from December 16, 2024, to January 14, 2025.\n",
      "   - There is a potential double bottom formation around the $316-$320 level, which suggests that this area is a strong support level. The stock tested this support on January 10, 2025, and slightly rebounded on January 13, 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Support and Resistance Levels**:\n",
      "   - The support level is firmly established around $316-$320, as seen from the multiple instances where the price tested and rebounded from this range.\n",
      "   - The resistance level is near $356, as indicated by the peak on December 16, 2024, where the stock reached a high close to this level before reversing downward.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Technical Indicators**:\n",
      "   - The Relative Strength Index (RSI) may be approaching oversold conditions given the recent decline, suggesting a potential buying opportunity if the RSI falls below 30.\n",
      "   - The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) likely shows bearish momentum, as the stock has been on a downward trend. However, if a bullish crossover occurs, it could signal a reversal.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Entry Points and Price Targets**:\n",
      "   - A potential entry point would be near the support level of $316-$320, especially if the RSI indicates oversold conditions and starts to rise.\n",
      "   - A short-term price target could be set near the resistance level of $356, assuming a successful rebound from the support.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Market Sentiment and Insider Activity**:\n",
      "   - Despite the bearish short-term trend, the stock is trading below its intrinsic value, with a projected 58% increase in earnings over the next few years. This long-term positive outlook could offset short-term volatility.\n",
      "   - Insider selling might contribute to the current bearish sentiment, but investors should weigh this against the company's strong fundamentals and growth prospects.\n",

(NYSE:CRM)? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Tue, Jan 14, 2025, 11:00 PM 3 min read In This Article: CRM +1.40% Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth of 12% on the NYSE over the last few months. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Salesforce’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Salesforce What Is Salesforce Worth? Great news for investors – Salesforce is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $455.86, but it is currently trading at US$319 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Salesforce’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility. What does the future of Salesforce look like? NYSE:CRM Earnings and Revenue Growth January 14th 2025 Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Salesforce's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 58%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. What This Means For You Are you a shareholder? Since CRM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation. Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CRM for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CRM. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CRM. As of 2025-01-14, Salesforce Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $303.13. It's currently trading at a price of $319.07. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -5.26%. The company is fair valued. Unlocking Intrinsic Value: Analysis of Salesforce Inc The model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Salesforce Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps. Assumptions Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $9.7 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.78%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 36.90% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation. Calculation Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 366.25 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 561.77 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 303.13 Discounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $378.63. This valuation indicates that the Salesforce Inc is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 15.73%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page. Story Continues The Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model: Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized. Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate. Navigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).
