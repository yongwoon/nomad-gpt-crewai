      "Since the dawn of cinema, the box office has been a crucial element in the movie industry that can easily make or break a film depending on its financial performance. In recent years, the number of movie goers has unfortunately dwindled at the theaters, which has taken a massive toll on the box office and hurt movies that actually earn rave reviews from audiences and critics. \n",
      "The year 2024 gave movie fans a handful of solid films, but it also delivered a string of bombs at the box office which is likely to be expected in any year. While there are a few films that received positive reviews but fell short of their projected numbers, there were also a handful of movies, such as The Crow, Joker: Folie á Deux, and Borderlands that just tanked both with audiences and the box office. Out of all the movies released in 2024, including The Fall Guy, Fly Me to the Moon, and Argylle, these are the ten biggest bombs at the box office, ranked. \n",

      "Image via Lionsgate\n",
      "The science-fiction action comedy, Borderlands, is one film of the year that came and went, barely making a dent in the box office opening weekend. Based on the video game series by the same name, Borderlands stars Cate Blanchett as an outlaw who returns to her home planet where she forms an alliance with a group of misfits to try and find the daughter of the most powerful man in the universe.\n",
      "According to Deadline, Borderlands was projected to cost the studio $20 to $30 million dollars due to its disappointing release, but the film did cause an increase in sales of the video game, proving at least a minor silver lining to its failure. Aside from failing at the box office, Borderlands was also panned by audiences and critics, citing it as a mediocre adaptation that fell short in every area imaginable.\n",

      "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is the latest installment in George Miller's franchise that, despite performing poorly at the box office, did earn overall positive reviews. The film follows the origin story of Fury Road character, Furoisa, played by Anya Taylor-Joy and Alyla Browne, and her journey from being kidnapped as a child all the way to her rise to the rank of Imperator.\n",
      "Many critics and outlets, including Collider's Chris McPherson cited the lack of interest in the famous franchise and its prequels were a major contribution to the film's downfall. The movie earned five out of five stars from Empire's John Nugent, who praised Taylor-Joy's performance, noting it to be a fitting tribute to Charlize Theron's original character. The fact that Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga did receive numerous positive reviews just proves that sometimes the box office isn't always a movie's ultimate deciding factor. \n",

      "Ryan Gosling stars in the action comedy, The Fall Guy, as a stuntman, Colt Seavers, who comes out of retirement to work on an upcoming film directed by his former girlfriend (Emily Blunt). When the star of the movie suddenly disappears, Seavers soon finds himself in the middle of an unexpected conspiracy. The Fall Guy is another film that received rather exceptional reviews but sadly failed to stick the landing at the box office.\n",
      "Overall, the movie earned a worldwide total of over one-hundred and eighty million dollars. According to Variety, The Fall Guy would have had to gross between $275 to $300 million dollars in order to break even, ultimately resulting in a financial loss for the studio. Despite flopping at the box office, several critics commended The Fall Guy for its level of entertainment, which was a refreshing change from today's heavy CGI and lack of character development seen in most movies. \n",

      "Fly Me to the Moon is a romantic comedy set during the approaching days of NASA launching Apollo 11 for its historical moon landing. While NASA feels confident in their mission, they decide to lean towards the side of caution and resort to orchestrating a fake moon landing in case the mission goes south. They recruit an advertising executive (Scarlett Johansson) who must work with one of NASA's launch directors (Channing Tatum) and other staff members to put on a convincing show.\n",
      "Fly Me to the Moon flopped at the box office but not as hard as some of the other films of 2024. It was projected to earn about $12 million during the opening weekend, but it still came up short, earning only a little north of $4 million. Despite the film's star-power and unique concept, Fly Me to the Moon wasn't well received by general audiences, but some critics did praise Johansson and Tatum's screwball comedic chemistry as the film's saving grace.\n",

      "Guy Ritchie's action-packed movie The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is set during World War II and follows a group of men who are recruited by Winston Churchill to exterminate Adolf Hitler's fleet of U-Bombers. The team operates under the radar, allowing them to use unconventional methods to complete their mission and hopefully change the course of the war. The film is a highly fictionalized telling of Operation Postmaster and is based on the 2014 novel, Churchill's Secret Warriors: The Explosive True Story of the Special Forces Desperados of WWII by Damien Lewis.\n",
      "Even though the film had Ritchie at the helm captaining a star-studded cast including Henry Cavill, Cary Elwes and Smallville's Alan Ritchson, nothing could've saved this movie from sinking at the box office, grossing only a little over $27 million on a $60 million dollar budget. The main issue with The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is that it was presented with a ready-to-go and compelling story but instead, it was drowned out by oversaturated action and a mindless structure that failed to capture the importance of the real-life heroes and their dangerous mission.\n",

Bryce Dallas Howard stars in the espionage comedy as a best-selling author, Elly Conway, who has gained success with her book series about a secret agent named Argylle. When the plots of Conway's books begin to reflect the actions of a real-life spy operation, she's thrown into a world that toes the line between reality and fiction.\n",

With a $200 million dollar budget, Argylle only earned $96 million at the global box office, deeming it to be a disappointing box office bomb. To add insult to injury, the film earned overall negative reviews, many addressing how the film starts off with an exciting, silly twist on the traditional spy thriller but loses its momentum about mid-way through.\n",

      "Many film fans had high hopes for Francis Ford Coppola's highly anticipated movie, Megalopolis, which had been delayed several times, creating more suspense for its debut. When it finally made it to the silver screen, many were baffled by the epic science-fiction film drama that seemed more focused on presenting a visual spectacle than a compelling story. Set in an alternate 21st century, Megalopolis follows an ambitious architect (Adam Driver) whose visions cause him to clash with opposing forces of power, especially the city's mayor (Giancarlo Esposito).\n",
      "The Godfather director has a reputation for genre hopping, ranging from intense dramas to romantic comedies, but no one could have ever expected the utter tragedy of Megalopolis, which only earned $13 million (against a whooping $136 million dollar budget) at the box office. Instead of delivering a captivating narrative, Coppola's Megalopolis is essentially a series of visually stunning scenes that, aside from their visual appeal, come off like a bewildering and confusing puzzle.\n",

      "There are some movies that should never be remade and when fans learned that the 1994 movie The Crow was set to be remade, almost everyone knew it would be a major flop. The original film has almost a sacred legacy that is beloved and protected by fans, not only due to Brandon Lee's tragic death but also, his incomparable performance that is impossible to match, let alone surpass. Bill Skarsgård stars as Eric Davern who, along with his soulmate, are brutally murdered and when he's given the chance to save his true love by sacrificing himself, he takes the opportunity to seek his revenge against those who took their lives.\n",
      "Deadline called the premiere of The Crow \"disastrous,\" earning only a total of $24 million worldwide against a $50 million dollar budget. It's hard to understand how and why anyone thought remaking this treasured cult classic would be even somewhat of a success and, while it's not a knock against Skarsgård, the film felt like a cheap money grab the studio thought they could pull off with some over-the-top action and gore. The original had its fair share of violence and bloodshed, but unlike the remake, its main appeal was Lee's tour de force performance as well as the magnitude of storytelling.\n",

      "Marvel's Madame Web made history as one of the lowest-grossing films in the comic franchise, becoming the ultimate punch-line of superhero movies. The film follows the origin story of Cassie Web (Dakota Johnson) who, after discovering that she has supernatural powers, tries to save three other women from Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), who wants to kill them before they can become Spider-Women in the future.\n",
      "Surprisingly, Madame Web broke close to even at the box office, earning a little over $100 million worldwide against nearly the same budget. With any Marvel film, fans will almost always flock to the theaters to see it, but while Madame Web also failed to accumulate any significant profit, it also earned painfully negative reviews from critics. The movie has an initially interesting approach, but it essentially unfolds with an uneven and choppy execution, feeling broken and jumbled with several humorous moments that were not intended to be comical. Between its airless, stiff tone and mechanical storyline, Madame Web is without question Sony's worst film in the entire Spider-Man Universe to date.\n",

      "After the immense success of Todd Phillips' stand-alone film, Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix, fans were thrilled to learn that a second film was in the works. Considered to be one of the year's most anticipated films, Joker: Folie á Deux is a less than inspired sequel which was met with less than positive reviews and is easily the year's most surprising box office bomb. The film picks up with Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) who is being held at Arkham Asylum and as he struggles with his duel identity, he meets the love of his life, Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga).\n",
      "Fans were aware that the film was set to be a musical, but no one ever expected to see the absolute disaster which unfolded on the big screen, resulting in many viewers walking out of the theaters mid-way through. Joker: Folie á Deux grossed over $200 million at the global box office and, according to Variety, the film's even breaking point was about $450 million, resulting in a hefty financial loss for Warner Bros. Even though other films of 2024 tanked hard at the box office, there's no denying that Joker: Folie á Deux takes the cake as the biggest box office bomb of the year. \n",

      "\t“Joker: Folie à Deux” was primed to be another twisted comic book smash. Instead, the sequel to 2019’s billion-dollar hit “Joker” is a box office disaster.\n",
      "\tSo far, the offbeat musical about Batman’s notorious foe has grossed $51.5 million domestically and $165 million globally after two weeks of release. By comparison, the first “Joker” had generated $96.2 million domestically and $248.4 million globally after three days of release. The sequel won’t earn anywhere near that much by the end of its theatrical run, with ticket sales projected to stall at a lifetime gross of $65 million domestically and $210 million to $215 million globally when “Folie à Deux” leaves the big screen.\n",

      "\tThat’s a huge problem because “Joker 2” cost $200 million to produce and roughly $100 million to market and distribute. At this rate, the film won’t get anywhere close to the $450 million needed to break even in its theatrical run (ticket sales are split between studios and theater owners). Sources at Warner Bros. say the movie will break even at $375 million. After critics and audiences flat out rejected the big-budget tentpole, which received a 33% “rotten” average on Rotten Tomatoes and a rare “D” grade on CinemaScore, it’s shaping up to be one of the year’s biggest catastrophes. It’s now poised to lose at least $150 million to $200 million in its theatrical run, according to the estimates of insiders as well as three rival executives with knowledge of similar productions. One source speculates the film will end up losing its backers just north of $200 million, while another believes the damages may be closer to $125 million.\n",
      "\t\t\tPopular on Variety\t\t\n",
      "\t“Any estimates suggested by anonymous ‘insiders’ or ‘rival executives’ are grossly wrong and continues a trend where rumor is reported as fact,” a Warner Bros. spokesperson said in a statement. “The film continues to play in theatrical release, included with this week’s opening in China, and will continue to earn revenue throughout its home viewing and ancillary run.”\n",
      "\tWarner Bros. does have the potential to recoup at least a bit of its investment when “Folie à Deux” lands on home entertainment platforms on Oct. 29. Yet its paltry grosses represent a shocking collapse from “Joker,” which became an unlikely and undisputed box office champion with $335 million in North America and $1.078 billion worldwide. It stood at the time as the highest grossing R-rated movie in history. Disney’s Marvel sequel “Deadpool & Wolverine” supplanted that record in the U.S. ($635 million) and worldwide ($1.32 billion) over the summer, though “Joker” remains the biggest R-rated international release with $743 million. Budgeted at roughly $65 million, “Joker” was one of the most profitable comic book adaptations ever made — although Warner Bros. had to split the riches with two co-financiers, which the studio added to mitigate risk on the unconventional DC antihero story. Warners has one co-financier, Domain, on the sequel.\n",
      "\tGiven the monster success of “Joker,” which also scored two Oscars, it’s not surprising that “Folie à Deux” was greentlit and granted a bigger budget. But the outsize price point is one that makes it difficult for most films to achieve profitability in the current box office landscape. Much of the reason for the follow-up film’s gargantuan price tag was because of fees for director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix (returning as disturbed stand-up Arthur Fleck), both of whom earned $20 million upfront, as well as Lady Gaga (joining as fellow Arkham inmate Harleen “Lee” Quinzel), who pocketed $12 million.\n",
      "\t“If the filmmakers and studio were committed to making a sequel — and why wouldn’t they be after the first film made $1.08 billion — they faced a very difficult challenge of telling a new chapter that kept the audience engaged,” says analyst David A. Gross of movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. \n",
      "\tBox office analysts believe that Phillips alienated the DC fan base by bringing song and dance numbers into the sequel, resulting in the cavernous difference in sales between the first and second “Joker” entries. While the original was a dark and grisly drama that borrowed from Martin Scorsese’s filmography of “Taxi Driver” and “King of Comedy,” the next chapter plays as a fantasy musical — and includes covers of “That’s Life,” “Get Happy” and “For Once in My Life” — as Arthur Fleck awaits trial for murder.\n",
      "\t“The first ‘Joker’ was a timely, fresh counterpoint to the dominant superhero narrative and tone, and it worked,” Gross adds. “The filmmakers deserve credit for making more unconventional creative choices in ‘Folie,’ adding the romantic angle with Lady Gaga. But this time nothing worked.”\n",
      "\t“Joker” was released at boon times for comic book tentpoles, when the mere idea of superhero fatigue seemed laughable. But the genre has been proven to be less resilient in the post-pandemic era. “Joker: Folie à Deux” joins the ignominious trio of 2023’s “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” and “The Marvels” — all three are follow-ups to billion-dollar tentpoles that completely collapsed at the box office and became big money-losers. The sequel to 2018’s “Aquaman” tapped out with $439 million globally while the sequel to 2019’s “Captain Marvel” ended its run with just $206 million globally. Those misfires proved audiences will no longer show up simply because there’s a DC or Marvel logo in the title credits.\n",
      "\t“Superheroes used to be able to guarantee some level of opening weekend grosses, but there’s no floor anymore,” says one rival studio executive on the condition of anonymity. “Tolerance for films that are ‘just OK’ doesn’t cut it anymore.” \n",

      "Sony Pictures CEO Tony Vinciquerra recently told the Los Angeles Times that “Kraven the Hunter” is “probably the worst launch we had” in the nearly eight years he’s been at the studio, adding: “I still don’t understand, because the film is not a bad film.”\n",
      "\t“Kraven” opened in theaters Dec. 13 to a paltry $11 million, the lowest debut yet for a Sony-released Marvel movie. The movie’s current domestic box office total stands at just $18 million, while its global haul is $43 million. These are more or less catastrophic results for a superhero movie and cap off a lackluster year for Sony comic book movies after “Madame Web” flopped with $100 million worldwide and “Venom: The Last Dance” became the franchise’s lowest-grossing entry. \n",

      "\t“Let’s just touch on ‘Madame Web’ for a moment,” Vinciquerra said. “‘Madame Web’ underperformed in the theaters because the press just crucified it. It was not a bad film, and it did great on Netflix. For some reason, the press decided that they didn’t want us making these films out of ‘Kraven’ and ‘Madame Web,’ and the critics just destroyed them. They also did it with ‘Venom,’ but the audience loved ‘Venom’ and made ‘Venom’ a massive hit. These are not terrible films. They were just destroyed by the critics in the press, for some reason.”\n",
      "\t\t\tPopular on Variety\t\t\n",
      "\tThe critics’ aversion to Sony’s Marvel movies is one reason Vinciquerra thinks the studio needs to “rethink” how it moves forward with its Spider-Man universe tentpoles. \n",
      "\t“It’s snake-bitten. If we put another one out, it’s going to get destroyed, no matter how good or bad it is,” he told the LA Times.\n",
      "\tWhile Vinciquerra doesn’t believe Marvel’s Sony movies are terrible movies, critics would disagree. “Madame Web” holds a 11% on Rotten Tomatoes, while “Kraven” didn’t perform much better with reviewers and has a 15% Rotten Tomatoes score.\n",
      "\tIn addition to “Madame Web” and “Kraven,” Sony also earned negative reviews and bad box office with its Jared Leto-starring “Morbius” movie. Sony insiders acknowledged to Variety earlier this month that “Kraven,” “Madame Web” and “Morbius” were creative and critical duds (even if they also insist that “Morbius,” which made $167.4 million globally, did turn a profit). Moving forward, they said, the studio will need to be more discerning about which — if any — of the studio’s stable of Spider-Man characters should be elevated into their own movie franchise.\n",
      "\tSony is currently working with Disney’s Marvel Studios on a fourth “Spider-Man” movie set to star Tom Holland. Head over to the Los Angeles Times’ website to read Vinciquerra’s latest profile in its entirety.\n",

      "\tAfter 16 years of fits and starts, a $50M reboot of 1994 goth thriller The Crow finally flew into theaters and dropped out of the sky with a disastrous $4.6M opening.\n",
      "\tForget about critics plucking the feathers from The Crow at 19%, those moviegoers who attended Thursday night, predominantly fans, slammed the movie on Comscore/Screen Engine’s PostTrak with one star, a 47% grade and a 36% definite recommend. \n",

      "\tNews\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\tSam Pressman Talks ‘The Crow’ Reboot, Continuing His Father’s Legacy And Why Industry Should Look To Embrace AI\t\t\n",
      "Lionsgate limited its skin in the game with a $10M North American acquisition and $15M P&A on this Rupert Sanders-directed take, starring burgeoning IT and John Wick: Chapter 4 genre star Bill Skarsgård. At the end of the day, the studio stands to lose more — in the neighborhood of $30M — on its $110M-plus feature take of gonzo sci-fi video game Borderlands.\n",
      "\t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t\n",
      "\tSo why make a big deal here on The Crow? Even if, let’s say, Lionsgate possibly breaks even in pic’s sixth ancillary cycle down the road?\n",
      "\tAt a time when theatrical is raging back, and the key to success lies in IP, it stands to reason that a Crow for the current 18-34 generation would be willed into existence. However, if there’s a takeaway here, it’s that some reboots of storied IP are better left unmade. That’s a hard pill to swallow when current mass moviegoers are embracing long-delayed franchise sequels, i.e. Top Gun: Maverick, Bad Boys for Life and even Star Wars: The Force Awakens. \n",
      "\tGranted, The Crow was always horror niche and didn’t exactly scream yippy skippy, but the 1994 title did break out (read on). The original movie follows a grim reaper, if you will, who is released from the grave by a supernatural crow and makes it his business to right the wrongs of those who were unjustly killed. In the original, Brandon Lee’s protag and his girlfriend Shelly are murdered at the onset.\n",
      "\tHowever, any future for The Crow franchise’s legacy always stood in the shadow of its late star, Lee, who died on the set in 1993 after shot with a prop gun. Similar to his father Bruce Lee, who died suddenly in 1973 in 1973 at 32, Brandon Lee promptly developed cult-icon status following his death, which fueled great interest in the movie. Adding to that was the pic’s milieu itself, a great nod to the goth and industrial alternative sensibilities of the 1990s prevalent in music at the time. Although it opened at $11.7M on May 14, 1994, the pic legged out to a great 4x multiple with $50.7M at the domestic box office. In 2024 inflated dollars based off an average ticket price of $12.61 this past weekend, per EntTelligence, and admissions for the original movie of 2.8 million, the 1994 Crow opened to $35.5M and legged to $152.9M based on domestic admissions of 12.1M. Wow. The film reportedly was made for $23M.\n",
      "\tHistory is everything, and if there was any sign to avoid any attempt to remake The Crow, that clearly could be seen in the grosses and even distribution of the previous titles in the franchise. The 1996 sequel, The Crow: City of Angels, starring Vincent Perez and Mia Kirshner, opened to $9.7M and did less than 2x multiple at the domestic B.O. ending its run at $17.9M. Subsequent sequels The Crow: Salvation starring Kirsten Dunst in 2000 and The Crow: Wicked Prayer (2005), starring Edward Furlong, Dennis Hopper and Tara Reid, largely were home entertainment plays with limited theatrical grosses unreported. It was clear the fans weren’t biting then, why would they even be interested again?\n",
      "\tThe yearning to make a top-notch reboot of The Crow based on James O’Barr’s comic series goes back to 2008, with Ryan Kavanaugh’s Relativity Media at one point in talks to make the movie with Pressman; that initial plan foiled by a legal battle with the Weinstein Company, which retained global rights. But Relativity would bob in and out of the various iterations in development up until its bankruptcy. Big names such as Bradley Cooper, Mark Wahlberg, Channing Tatum — who, coincidentally, had his second bomb of the summer this weekend in Blink Twice — Ryan Gosling, Jack Huston, Luke Evans and even Bill’s brother Alexander Skarsgård circled the role of protagonist Eric Draven. The most recent iteration prior to the Sanders’ version had The Nun‘s Corin Hardy attached to direct and Jason Momoa starring. Both would exit at the same time. Hardy posted on social that he had creative differences with The Crow rights holder, producer Samuel Hadida (who passed in November 2018). The latest version with Sanders directing came together during the first half of 2022, with production commencing in July that year in Prague.\n",
      "\tBut complications ensued — chiefly, I’m told, the filmmaker and producers did not see eye-to-eye. The pic’s legendary producer Edward Pressman died as the film was being assembled, with his son Sam Pressman serving as EP. When the production was looking to do a pickup shoot last spring, the writers strike hit. Lionsgate Motion Picture Group Chair Adam Fogelson had a great working relationship with Sanders during his Universal brass days on Snow White and the Huntsmen ($397M worldwide) and rolled the dice on taking North American right; a good chunk of the pic’s production cost funded via foreign sales sold out via FilmNation. \n",
      "RELATED: Edward Pressman: Appreciation For The Rebel In A Bow Tie By Alessandro Camon \n",
      "\tFurthermore, Lionsgate had a good working relationship with Skarsgård from John Wick: Chapter 4 and the Roadside Attractions co-acquisition Boy Kills World. The latest Crow originally was scheduled on June 7 but had to move when Bad Boys: Ride or Die drove onto the date. No bother, that early-summer release would have incurred the studio some significant post-production rush charges, which were avoided. Lionsgate promoted the movie during its CinemaCon presentation film as the studio doesn’t orphan its non-homemade titles.\n",
      "\tHowever, the launch of the first trailer and its amassing of dislikes received public attention from the original Crow director Alex Proyas — his protests providing zero favors to the pic.\n",
      "\tWhen a photo dropped in February if Skarsgård and FKA twigs from the film, Proyas snarked on social, “Eric Draven’s having a bad hair day. Next reboot please.”\n",
      "\tHe soon followed that up with a Facebook post that read: “I think the fan’s response speaks volumes. [The Crow] is not just a movie. Brandon Lee died making it, and it was finished as a testament to his lost brilliance and tragic loss. It is his legacy. That’s how it should remain.”\n",
      "\tFrom there, bad word-of-mouth spread like wildfire up until opening. Social media analytics corp RelishMix reported that The Crow had an online universe reach across TikTok, Facebook, X, YouTube and Instagram at 76.7M — 45% under the action-horror norm.\n",
      "\tObserved RelishMix: “Negative convo on The Crow touches ordinary comparative notes with ‘disappointment’ toward the new adaptation and ‘disrespect’ toward the original. Fans express strong attachments to Brandon Lee’s iconic portrayal and are disappointed by the casting choices and perceived tonal shifts in the remake: ‘The original had a certain feeling, a certain atmosphere, I just don’t think this is hitting in the same way as the old one did.'”\n",
      "Wall Street Journal‘s Kyle Smith astutely opined that the latest rendition was at a “slow, tortured pace” and a “ghoulish reworking of Groundhog Day.”\n",
      "\tSmith further expounded: “Mr. Sanders has removed almost all of the trashy fun from the 1994 telling; the swaggering style and the confident glint in Lee’s eye have been displaced by nonstop gloom and misery. Is anguish a superpower? Though Mr. Skarsgård (who played the terrifying Pennywise in IT) is gravely charismatic and FKA twigs is touching, the dour, depressing dankness of Mr. Sanders’s vision makes The Crow a turkey.”\n",
      "\tSays one insider connected to the reboot of The Crow and why it failed to connect with audiences: “Opera is hard. Opera is not about logic, it’s about emotion.”\n",

      "# The Biggest Box Office Flops of 2024: A Deep Dive\n",
      "\n",
      "2024 was a roller-coaster ride for the film industry with some unexpected ups and downs. As we look back, let's delve into some of the major box office disappointments that left us all surprised. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction \n",
      "In a world that is constantly looking for the next big hit, the reality of the box office can be harsh. For every record-breaking blockbuster, there are films that don't live up to expectations. This post will dissect three of 2024's biggest box office flops - 'Joker: Folie á Deux', 'Madame Web', and 'The Crow'. We will explore what went wrong and how they ended up in the red.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Joker: Folie á Deux\n",
      "The anticipated sequel to the 2019 hit, 'Joker: Folie á Deux' turned out to be a significant financial loss for Warner Bros. Despite a global box office accumulation of over $200 million, the film fell short of its break-even point by a large margin. According to [Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/news/joker-folie-a-deux-lose-warner-bros-millions-box-office-flop-1236176479/), the film's massive budget, disappointing audience reception, and deviation from the original film's tone played a part in its downfall.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Madame Web\n",
      "S.J. Clarkson's 'Madame Web' barely broke even at the box office and was met with negative reviews. The film had potential for streaming success but fell short in the eyes of the critics. According to the [CEO](https://variety.com/2024/film/news/sony-ceo-blames-madame-web-kraven-flops-critics-1236259938/), the film's failure can be attributed more to the criticism it received than its quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Crow\n",
      "Rupert Sanders' reboot of 'The Crow' saw a dismal box office performance, earning only $24 million against a budget of $50 million. The film failed to resonate with audiences who felt it disrespected the original. The [misaligned tone and poor adaptation](https://deadline.com/2024/08/box-office-the-crow-bombs-analysis-1236050350/) of the original's atmosphere were among the criticisms it faced.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "The film industry is a risky business, and the box office can be unforgiving. While these films did not perform well, they serve as important case studies for understanding the intricate dynamics of filmmaking, marketing, and audience reception. As we look forward to 2025, we can only hope for better outcomes for the industry.\n",
