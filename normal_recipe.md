### Preparation Instructions:

#### Greek Salad:
1. In a large salad bowl, combine tomatoes, cucumber, green bell pepper, red onion, feta cheese, and olives.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper.
3. Pour the dressing over the salad ingredients and toss gently to combine.
4. Set aside to marinate for about 10 minutes before serving.

#### Moussaka:
1. Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Sprinkle eggplant slices with salt and let them sit for 10 minutes to release moisture. Rinse and pat dry.
3. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Fry eggplant slices until golden brown on both sides. Remove and drain on paper towels.
4. In the same skillet, add onion and garlic, and sauté until soft. Add ground lamb or beef and cook until browned.
5. Stir in chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, cinnamon, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 15 minutes until the sauce thickens.
6. In a baking dish, layer half of the eggplant slices, followed by the meat sauce, and then the remaining eggplant slices.
7. For the béchamel sauce, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk and cook until it thickens. Remove from heat and stir in egg yolks, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
8. Pour the béchamel sauce over the layered eggplant and meat, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
9. Bake for 45 minutes or until the top is golden brown. Allow to cool slightly before serving.

#### Tzatziki with Pita Bread:
1. In a bowl, combine Greek yogurt, grated cucumber, garlic, olive oil, dill, lemon juice, and salt.
2. Mix well and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.
3. Warm pita breads in the oven or on a skillet and slice into wedges.
